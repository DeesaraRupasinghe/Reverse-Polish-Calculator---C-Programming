# Reverse-Polish-Calculator---C-Programming
This project implements a Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) calculator using a stack in C. It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Instructions include pushing operands (? a), performing operations (+, -, *, /), and printing the stack's top value (=). Evaluate expressions like ? a ? b + = and ? a ? b + ? c ? d + * =.
