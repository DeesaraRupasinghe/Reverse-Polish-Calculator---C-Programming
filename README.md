This repository implements a Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) calculator in C. It provides a command-line interface for evaluating RPN expressions and supports basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).

Key Features:

RPN Evaluation: Evaluates Reverse Polish Notation expressions.
Basic Arithmetic: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Error Handling: Includes basic checks for invalid expressions and division by zero (expand on this if you plan to implement more robust error handling).
Group Project: Designed for collaborative development in a university group setting.
This repository is ideal for:

Students learning RPN and its evaluation.
Developers seeking a simple RPN calculator implementation in C.
Anyone who wants to explore and contribute to a collaborative coding project.
